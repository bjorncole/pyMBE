# These adapters describe how to make SysML subgraphs of the LPG

Banded Graph:
  description: |
    Generate library settings for a "banded graph" of types, generalization, and feature membership to capture both SysML v1 and v2 styled composition structures
  included_edge_types:
  - FeatureMembership
  - FeatureTyping
  - Superclassing
  reversed_edge_types:
  - FeatureMembership
  - FeatureTyping

Expanded Banded Graph:
  description: |
    Generate library settings for a expanded version of banded graph to accommodate expression tree relationships
  included_edge_types:
  - FeatureMembership
  - FeatureTyping
  - FeatureValue
  - ParameterMembership
  - ReturnParameterMembership
  - Superclassing
  reversed_edge_types:
  - FeatureMembership
  - FeatureTyping
  - FeatureValue
  - ParameterMembership
  - ReturnParameterMembership

Part Definition Graph:
  description: |
    Generate library settings for a graph that just looks at superclassing and part definitions
  included_node_types:

Part Featuring Graph:
  description: |
