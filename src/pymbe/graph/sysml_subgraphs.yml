# These adapters describe how to make SysML subgraphs of the LPG

Complete:
  description: |
    This is the complete graph, it will be stripped if the size of the graph exceeds 'max_graph_size' traitlet in the LPG.
  excluded_edge_types: []
  excluded_node_types: []

Banded Graph:
  description: |
