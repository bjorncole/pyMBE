# These adapters describe how to make SysML subgraphs of the LPG
# A projection must have:
#   - a unique name, e.g., "Complete"
#   - a description
# filters:
#   - `excluded_edge_types`: the metatype of relationships to ignore
#   - `excluded_node_types`: the metatype of non-relationship elements to ignore
#   - `included_edge_types`: the metatype of relationships to bring in
#   - `included_node_types`: the metatype of non-relationship elements to bring in
# modifiers:
#   - `reversed_edge_types`: the metatype of the relationships to reverse the order
#
# Notes:
# Filters:
#   It is not possible to define both inclusion and exclusion for a given type (nodes/edges).
#
# Implied Edges:
#   To include implied edge generators, include the node types for generators defined in the code.
#   Adding a new implied edge, requires modifying the code that defines how to manipulate the data
#   to generate the new edges.
