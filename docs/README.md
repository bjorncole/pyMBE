# pymbe Documentation
The documentation is provided as Jupyter notebooks.  These notebooks are organized into four categories:

* **Tutorials**: explain how to use `pymbe`
* **How-to Guides**: walk through how to accomplish common tasks
* **Reference**: describe the implementation (in the future this will also include auto-generated documentation)
* **Explanatory**: explain the theory behind `pymbe` (there are currently no explanatory notebooks)

The `experimental` notebooks are not fully refined and should not be considered stable.
